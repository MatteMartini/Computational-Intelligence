# Lab 2: Nim

## Introduction to the game and strategies adopted

Nim is a strategic mathematical game involving two players who alternate turns in removing, or "nimming," objects from separate piles. During each turn, a player is required to take away a minimum of one object, with the option to remove multiple objects, as long as they originate from the same pile. The objective of the game varies based on the version being played; it can be either to refrain from taking the final object or to be the one to take the last object. In our case the player taking the last object wins.

The lab has tasked us with develop a **rule-based agent** and an **evolutionary-based agent** able to play the Nim game.
