# Lab 9: One-Max

## Introduction to the problem

The One-Max problem is a trivial problem often used to introduce the concept of genetic algorithms. It’s incredibly simple, but it’s great for introducing many of the critical aspects of a genetic algorithm. The problem boils down to one question: what is the maximum sum of a bitstring (a string consisting of only 1s and 0s) of length N.

Given a black-box fitness function, our goal is to solve problem instances 1, 2, 5 and 10 with the minimum number of fitness calls.
We are allowed to implement any algorithm we can think of, no rules.

## Solution

The proposed solutions are based on genetic algorithms with diversity promotion.
